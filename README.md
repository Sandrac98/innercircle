## Features 
### Existing Features
  Each page features a responsive navigation bar that is fixed in place and appears on every page of the site. This navigation bar includes links to the different pages of the website, such as the home page, about us page, gallery page, and the contact us page. 
  
![Nav Bar](./navbar.png)
The navigation bar is designed to be responsive, which means that it will adjust its layout and appearance to fit different screen sizes and devices. On small devices, the navigation bar will convert into a hamburger menu to allow for easier access. By including this navigation bar, the aim is to make it easy for users to move from page to page on the website and access the different sections without having to use the back button.

  - Provides more information about what visitors can expect at Inner Circle events. visitors get a better sense of what to expect at Inner Circle events and what they can look forward to. This can help build excitement and interest in the events, and may encourage visitors to attend or get more involved with Inner Circle. It also includes an illustration that features characters making the "Korean heart fingers" gesture. This gesture, also known as the "finger heart," is a common way for people in South Korea to show love or affection. It is made by placing the tip of the index finger against the tip of the thumb, forming a heart shape with the other fingers.

### Features Left to Implement

- I envision turning Inner Circle into an online store in the future, allowing anyone interested in purchasing official merchandise to do so without the necessity of attending an event. 
- In addition to converting Inner Circle into an online store, I also plan to add a calendar feature to the website, which will include information on upcoming events such as location and start time. Users will also have the option to create an account and register for these events.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
I utilized the W3 Validator to check each page of the website and found some errors in the navbar. However, this code was sourced from another website and I have included a link to the original source in the code. As a result, I have not attempted to fix the errors highlighted by the validator.
[navbar-error](./navbarerror.png)

- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](./css-validator.png)
### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
